# Demo Boxes 3D

This project was made with Threejs, 3-Fiber, 3-drei and React!

## About the Project

This demo app showcases the capabilities of Three.js, a powerful 3D rendering library, in combination with React Three Fiber, a React renderer for Three.js, and React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The app features a 3D scene with a floor and multiple boxes with endless wobble animation. The boxes are created using Three.js geometries and materials, and rendered in the scene using React Three Fiber components.

The app also demonstrates the use of basic Three.js concepts such as lighting, shadows, and camera controls, as well as the integration of custom controls and animations using React state and lifecycle methods.

Overall, this app serves as a simple but informative example of how to build interactive 3D experiences with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and React.
